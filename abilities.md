# Abilities of the App

## Data Exploration

  - All graphs, charts, and check box output will change with the
    selection of the season

  - View a graph of the number of wins, losses, and draws for a specific
    season
    
      - View Final Ranking by moving cursor over graph

  - Check the Champion and the three teams that were Relegated

  - A table displaying Final Ranking, Team, Wins, Losses, and Draws

## k Means Clustering

  - All graphs and tables will change with the selection of the season
    and the k clusters

  - Check to see how teams are clustered depending on the k Clusters
    
      - This could indicate some teams being “more” premier than others
        but would need further anaylsis to fully delve into that idea

  - View the Cluster Means

  - Graph the Distance Matrix

## k Nearest Neighbors

  - Most graphs and tables are affected by the changing of the k
    Observations

  - Graph the prediction of whether a team will be relegated for the
    next season

  - See the predicted versus the actual along with the frequency

  - Predicted whether a team will be relegated based on the wins,
    losses. draws, and goal difference
    
      - This table is not affected by the changing of k Observations

## Random Forest

Please note that due to the type of anaylsis this page does take some
time to load. A loading bar does display at the bottom right hand side
of the page.

  - All Graphs and Tables will change with the selection of the amount
    of predictors

  - Look at Rank of Importance of Predictors based on the Mean Decrease
    in Gini

  - See the Final Random Forest Model graph of the Errors vs the Trees

  - View the Accuracy and the Misclassification for the Random Forest
    model
    
      - Able to view both for Overall, Home, Away, and Draw for each
        number of predictors

  - View the predicted versus the actual result and whether or not it
    was correct

## Season Data

  - Scroll through all the data from the Soccer Data set that pertains
    to individual games for each season

  - Ability to look and a single season, a specific team, or a
    combination of the two

## Transfer Expenditure

  - Graphs and charts change with the selected season

  - View the amount of money spent on Winter Transfers and the rank
